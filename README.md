## How I continue to learn: demonstrated through validated solves of different rubic's type puzzles.

### My first validated solve!
December 8th 2020  
My times:
1. 35.24s
2. 37.78s
3. 1:06:16s
4. **22.38**s
5. 33.64s

This resulted in a Ao3 of: 35.55s  
_This solve was of the pyraminx puzzle; Personal best in bold_  

>As a first validated solve, I am very proud of the results. I believe that this is my first step in leading my own learning. It felt different learning in this manner and I believe it is a positive change from the regular presentation and copy notes that I am used to. I hope to continue finding the most efficient and entertaining learning method for me as I believe it will help me in the future.
