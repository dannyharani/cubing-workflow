# Cubing workflow
## How I continue to learn: demonstrated through validated solves of different rubic's type puzzles.

### My first validated solve!

My times:
1. 35.24s
2. 37.78s
3. 1:06:16s
4. **22.38**s
5. 33.64s

This resulted in a Ao3 of: 35.55s  
_This solve was of the pyraminx puzzle; Personal best in bold_
